## Welcome to Curdle!

## Downloads:
MacOS 64bit: [Download]([url](https://github.com/darkmatter684/Curdle/blob/gh-pages/CurdleMacOS-64.zip?raw=true))<br/>
Yeah that's kinda all we support currently :(

## Info
Welcome to my half-assed site for my app Curdle (I'm a python guy but I'm working on it). Curdle is a simple word game thats super lightweight on CPU. Anyways, there's a download link here somewhere for it, or you can edit the code on GitHub, I really dont mind.
