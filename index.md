## Welcome to Curdle! 😁

## The app
![Layout](CurdleUI.png)
<br/>Honestly, I can't post like 40000 images of the app, it's pretty simple. Here's the basic layout.

## Downloads:
MacOS 64bit: <a href="CurdleMacOS-64.zip">Download .dmg Installer</a> <br/>

## MacOS Download Info:
The code is not malware, I promise. Very reassuring, I know. Anyways, after downloading the installer, follow these instructions:

1. Install the app with the .dmg file.
2. Open up Terminal and copy paste the following:
    
    xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Curdle.app
    
3. Press enter/return

Then the app should work properly after this step is done. Once again, there is no malware and this is completly secure, I wouln't try and ever distrubute malicious files knowingly.

## Info
Welcome to my half-baked site for my app Curdle (I'm in in the process of learning CSS/HTML so yeah). Curdle is a simple, fun word game thats super lightweight on CPU. Futhermore, COMPLETELY FREE AND OPEN SOURCE!
